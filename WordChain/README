Word ladder game - From Wikipedia

A word ladder (also known as a doublets, word-links, or Word golf) is a word game invented by Lewis Carroll. 
A word ladder puzzle begins with two words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words to link the two, 
in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ by one letter.

Rule - 
The player is given a start word and an end word. In order to win the game, the player must change the start word into the end word progressively, 
creating an existing word at each step. Each step consists of a single letter substitution.

Example - 

COLD → CORD → CARD → WARD → WARM
